Major and minor decisions are made using informal consensus.</p> </li> <li> <p>Testing: GeoBlacklight has Continuous Integration Testing, and tests are expected to be written with code contributions to the project. The project also implements both Ruby and JavaScript style guides to ensure a stylistically similar codebase.</p> </li> <li> <p>Funding: There is no funding model for GeoBlacklight, and most development comes through volunteered or assigned time from contributing organizations.

For production uses, GeoBlacklight installations often require a SQL database such as MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>External service integration: GeoBlacklight provides a discovery layer for content that is oftentimes hosted elsewhere. Rather than try to provide a repository to the data itself and navigate the complexities of different adopters existing systems, GeoBlacklight relies on providing integration for existing datastores and web services. GeoBlacklight does this through providing useful preview, download, and exports of open standards-based services, including Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Feature Services (WFS), ArcGIS Rest API, and International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). There is also support for externally referenced metadata viewing and file download support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Metadata: The GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema has been designed to privilege discovery use cases.

The biggest evolution is the adoption of fields and concepts associated with the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) standard and the Project Open Data Metadata Schema, V. 1.1, including distribution fields. Distribution fields allow for increased flexibility in providing links to download multiple formats, pointing to reference codebooks and documentation, and integrating seamlessly with web APIs, such as GeoServer and IIIF endpoints. In the coming months, we expect the user interface of GeoBlacklight to reflect some of these new possibilities.</p> <p>For now, the team has created a development branch of GeoBlacklight for the new schema that includes example fixture documents of DCAT-compliant records. There are implications for moving toward the DCAT standard, the most significant of which is the need to \"flatten\" fully realized .JSON-LD metadata into .JSON files that comply with the Solr cores behind GeoBlacklight.

The team also reviewed all recent and backlogged GitHub issues and was able to address over 50 of them during the course of the.</p> <p>Here's a summary of some upgrades and changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>BLACKLIGHT 7 UPGRADE: The majority of the activities involved ensuring compatibility with Blacklight (the underlying architecture for GeoBlacklight) and its upcoming Blacklight 7 release. This included removing anticipated deprecations and incorporating Bootstrap 4.0 principles, such as a stylistic switch from pixels to rems.</p> </li> <li> <p>DOWNLOAD PANEL: The work to stay current with Bootstrap resulted a redesign of the Download tool to display a link to a direct download of the original dataset in one panel, with generated exports from a geospatial web server available underneath. This new Export Formats panel also features more semantically accurate text with the inclusion of the coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326) for generated exports. Here is a screenshot of the new layout:</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>METADATA BUGS: A few long standing bugs or omissions involving metadata interactions were addressed. The latest release allows certain characters, such as colons, in the record slugs, and handles empty values for the Geometry Type field. A new key was also added for the <code>dct_references</code> element to display native HTML records in the metadata viewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>INTERNATIONALIZATION: There is now better support for internationalization on view page elements - We fixed many lingering elements that had been hard-coded into English and turned them into translatable elements, which ultimately makes GeoBlacklight more accessible for use in other languages.</p> </li> <li> <p>TESTING WORKFLOWS: The GeoBlacklight GitHub repository was migrated to CircleCI instead of Travis CI for continuous integration and the metadata fixture records used for testing numerous functions were cleaned up and supplemented with new examples.</p> </li> <li> <p>LEAFLET MAP: Leaflet was upgraded to version 1.0, which required a few updates to the code. (Note - users looking to upgrade to the latest release of GeoBlacklight should check the release notes for potential issues with Leaflet 1.0 compatibilities.) The Leaflet map preview also includes new default basemaps - Now, users can toggle between seven default, open-source basemaps to use within the application.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2018/08/2018-summer-code-for-geoblacklight/#moving-forward","title":"Moving forward","text":"<p>The work on the summer has left us in a good place to cut a major 2.0 release of GeoBlacklight that will rely on upgraded frameworks.

These fields are used to highlight important information about a resource that users need to be aware of before accessing or using it. For example, a warning might indicate that the resource is incomplete or may be difficult to use due to technical limitations. A tip might provide guidance on how to use the resource effectively, such as suggesting specific software or tools that are compatible with the data. </p> <p>The main downside of custom fields is that they are not interoperable; when we share metadata across institutions, this information is lost. Another drawback is that custom fields require local development time to implement as opposed to functionality that comes with GeoBlacklight out-of-the-box.</p> <p>During the sprint, we devised a single field to capture this information, called \"Display Note\". This versatile field is inspired by website widgets known variably as callouts (general usage), admonitions (Python Markdown), or alerts (Bootstrap). Callouts are generally highlighted in colors and/or icons that indicate the type of information being offered, such as a red background for a Warning.  </p> <p>Details about the new field:</p> <ul> <li>URI: <code>gbl_displayNote_sm</code></li> <li>Multiplicity: this field is an array that can have multiple values</li> <li>Syntax: type of callout: text of callout</li> <li>Example value: <pre><code>[\n\"Warning: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a red box\",\n\"Info: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a blue box\",\n\"Tip: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a green box\",\n\"This is text without a tag and it will be assigned the default 'note' style\"\n]\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Right now, the field can be added to your GeoBlacklight Solr instance as a simple string field. In the next sprint, we plan to add functionality to GeoBlacklight that will automatically read the first part of the field (ex. Warning:) and display the text with highlight background prominently on the page. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/03/winter-sprint-2023/#versioning-and-roadmaps","title":"Versioning and roadmaps","text":"<p>We have a new Technology Matrix that maps out our GeoBlacklight release plans and technology dependencies.
